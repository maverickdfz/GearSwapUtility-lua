# GearSwapUtility-lua

An example job lua to be used along side the GearSwap addon and [GearSwapUtility](https://github.com/maverickdfz/GearSwapUtility)

Load the example json file and have a dig around

The example RDM.lua expects a file called RDM-sets.lua (example included)

RDM-sets.lua would be exported from [GearSwapUtility](https://github.com/maverickdfz/GearSwapUtility)
